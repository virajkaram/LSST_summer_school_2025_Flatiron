    "This notebook is prepared by Viraj Karambelkar (vk2588@columbia.edu) for the LSST CCA Summer School 2025, conducted at the Center for Computational Astrophysics from July 28 to August 8, 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Periodic signals are ubiquitous in astronomy. In addition to variable stars, periodic modulations in brightness are also exhibited by binary systems. Some of the most spectacular transient eruptions that we see have binary star progenitors, and as such, finding such binaries and characterizing them can provide heaps of information about how binary stars evolve and the fun explosions they undergo. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of the module is dedicated to period-finding techniques with a focus on the Lomb Scargle periodogram. This is followed by two activities, where you will analyze real data and study the progenitors of classical novae and red novae from the Milky Way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Review the basics of period-finding and Fourier Transforms. \n",
    "- Explore different features of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, and understand its applicability and limitations.\n",
    "- Gain a cursory understanding of the variety of period-finding algorithms used in astronomy.\n",
    "- Understand the challenges associated with period finding in real data from time-domain surveys.\n",
    "- Learn how to detect period changes in data.\n",
    "- Understand the capabilities of LSST for period-detection, and brainstorm ideas for periodicity searches in the LSST era.\n",

    "## 5. Beyond `LombScargle`\n",
    "There are many period-finding methods other than Lomb Scargle!\n",
    "\n",
    "[Graham et al. 2013](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.434.3423G/abstract) conducted a review of the efficacy of different methods on actual astronomical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "From Graham et al. 2013, there are three main categories of period-finding methods --\n",
    "\n",
    "- Those modeling a light curve via a least-squares fit to some set of (orthogonal) basis functions, most commonly trigonometric (LombScargle is in this category).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Those that phase-fold the data with a large number of trial periods and minimize some measure of the dispersion of time series data in phase space. Examples include binned means (Stellingwerf 1978), Phase Dispersion Minimization (Jurkevich 1971, Stellingwerth 1978), analysis-of-variance (Schwarzenberg-Czerny 1989), total distance between points (Dworetsky 1983), conditional entropy (Graham et al. 2013). Many of these methods do not assume any functional form for the signal, so non-sinusoidal signals can be identified easily. The Conditional Entropy algorithm in particular is known to suprress peaks due to aliasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Those that employ Bayesian inference. Recently, methods have been developed to use Gaussian Process regression to find periods in time-series astronomical signals [Wang et al. 2012](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...756...67W), [Angus et al. 2018](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.474.2094A).\n",
    "\n",
    "So which method is the best? Graham et al. 2013 found that the answer really depends on the problem at hand, and there is no one method that works well across all cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "So where is LombScargle useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "In my (limited) experience of period-finding in large datasets, I have found\n",
    "- LombScargle is very effective for long period variables (like AGB stars) that have periods larger than $\\approx$100 days. Rubin will find many many many of these in the Milky Way and other galaxies.\n",
    "- LombScargle also works well for pulsating stars with short periods that show sinusoidal-like lightcurve profiles with single-peaks in their phase folded lightcurves (e.g. Cepheids, RR Lyrae, asteroids). However, we need to  be careful about aliasing due to the window function, as the cadences of modern surveys tend to be similar to the periods of these sources.\n",
    "- LombScargle is not well-suited for eclipsing binaries or other short-period variables that do not show sinusoidal variations (we saw in an eclipsing binary previously) or have multiple humps in their phase-folded lightcurve. Algorithms that do not make assumptions about the pulse profile are better suited for these science cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there are a few different python implementations of the `LombScargle` algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of my favourite CPU-based implementation is from [gatspy](https://www.astroml.org/gatspy/). `gatspy` also lets you fit multiband data simultaneously to increase the fidelity of your period. (Be careful though - not all variables have same periodic behaviour in different filters)\n",

    "Looks ok? Note that most of the archival ZTF data is from its routine survey, and is reasonably noisy as the pre-explosion source is faint. The AAVSO data are taken at maximum light, but from a variety of telescopes. Despite this, we were still able to recover the periodic signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of what you can do with precise, high-cadence data, see [Patterson et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...940L..56P/abstract) who present dedicated observations of this nova that span a total of 1500 hours at a 60 second time resolution. From these observations, they can very precisely and reliably measure both the spin and the orbital periods. They also report detections of changes in the orbital and spin periods. Look at the phase-folded lightcurve for the orbital period from their paper and compare them to ours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivated by this comparison and what you know about LSST, discuss how these measurements will be different in the LSST era. What will be major discovery phases for periodicity searches of nova progenitors?"

    "# Activity 2: Period evolution in the red nova V1309Sco\n",
    "\n",
    "We have looked at how to detect periodic signals in lightcurves of astrophysical systems. However, several astrophysical systems exhibit periodic signals that change with time. This includes pulsating stars whose periods can change due to physical processes inside the star, or more exotic systems such as binary stars that are spiraling towards each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we will look at one of my favorite astrophysical sources the red nova V1309Sco - a stellar merger in our Milky Way (see [Tylenda et al. 2011](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2011/04/aa16221-10.pdf)). This source was special because there was extensive archival coverage by the OGLE survey. This showed that the progenitor binary was an eclipsing binary, with a period that was decreasing as the main merger-driven eruption approached. In this activity, you will examine the lightcurve of V1309Sco and examine the changing period. You will also learn about ways to detect periodicity evolution in binary systems.\n"

    "# The O-C diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "The O-C (Observed - Calculated) diagram is a powerful tool for studying periodic signals that change with time. It is used to visualize the difference between the observed times of maximum (or minimum) brightness and the expected times based on a constant period. The O-C diagram can reveal changes in the period of a system over time. To see how the O-C diagram works, let us examine the math.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a signal with period $P$, the expected time of maximum brightness $T_{\\rm{max}}$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$T_{\\rm{max}} = T_{0} + P(t)N$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T_{0}$ is the time of the first maximum, $P(t)$ is the period as a function of time, and $N$ is the number of cycles since $T_{0}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write the Taylor series expansion of $T_{\\rm{max}}$, retaining only up to the quadratic term, as\n",
    "\n",
    "$T_{\\rm{max}} \\approx T_{0} + \\frac{dT_{\\rm{max}}}{dN} (N - N_{0}) + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d^{2}T_{\\rm{max}}}{dN^{2}} (N - N_{0})^{2} $\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N_{0}$ is the number of cycles at $T_{0}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{d^{2}T_{\\rm{max}}}{dN^{2}} = \\frac{dP}{dN} = \\frac{dP}{dt}\\frac{dt}{dN} = \\dot{P}P$\n",
    "\n",
    "which gives $T_{\\rm{max}} = T_{0} + P(N - N_{0}) + \\frac{1}{2} P\\dot{P} (N - N_{0})^{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us define $O$ as the observed times of maximum brightness, and $C$ as the calculated times of maximum brightness based on a constant period $P_{\\rm{calc}}$ that is determined using the Lomb Scargle periodogram or some other method.\n",
    "\n",
    "$O = T_{\\rm{max}}$, and $C = T_{0} + P_{\\rm{calc}}(N - N_{0})$\n",
    "\n",
    "$O - C = (P - P_{\\rm{calc}})(N - N_{0}) + \\frac{1}{2}P\\dot{P}(N - N_{0})^{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$O - C = \\Delta P (N - N_{0}) + \\frac{1}{2}P\\dot{P}(N - N_{0})^{2} $ where $\\Delta P$ is the discrepancy between the true and estimated period.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is no period evolution, $O - C \\propto N$ : the O-C diagram will be a straight line with slope $\\Delta P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the period is changing at a constant rate, $O - C \\propto N^{2}$  : the O-C diagram will be a parabola with curvature $P\\dot{P}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the shape of the $O-C$ curve can be used to determine whether the period is changing and the rate at which it is changing.\n",
    "- Increasing period will result in a positive curvature (i.e. the parabola opens upwards), while a decreasing period will result in a negative curvature (i.e. the parabola opens downwards).\n",
    "- A steeper curvature implies a faster rate of change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note : The O-C curve name comes from the world of variable (single) stars. In the binary land, it is also referred to as a eclipse time variation (ETV) or eclipse time drift curve.\n",
    "\n",
